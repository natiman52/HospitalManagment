# A simple website which recreates a hospital managment software

Thanks for coming to this repo. to check the website first clone it, after cloning just install the requirments with
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

after that you need to setup weasyprint so the application can work just go to the link and choose your operating system https://doc.courtbouillon.org/weasyprint/v52.5/install.html

then you can run it and your done. If by any chance the public database is gone go to setting and change it to sqlite3 and you can continue with that database.
